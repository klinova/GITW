         <h1>Introducing: Geeks in the Woods</h1>
         <p>Last week, we hosted our first Geeks in the Woods.Geeks in the Woods was an official TUNE engineering off-site on one of the most beautiful islands in the country: Orcas Island in the San Juans of Washington State. It was three days of education, hacking and internal team building. Our co-founder and CTO, Lee Brown, said it best, “Our sales and marketing have the opportunity to travel to amazing conferences, so this is the opportunity for us engineers to travel to a cool spot and learn.” This was a time to empower our engineers to learn about new technologies and use this knowledge to push our company’s innovation forward.
